# ⚡ SI Chatbot Engine

**INSTANT. TINY. LIGHTWEIGHT.**  
A JavaScript-based chatbot system built for speed, minimal footprint, and smart responses — no server, no bloat, just semi-smartness! 🧠✨

---

## 💾 Key Features

- ⚡ **Instant**: Loads and replies in milliseconds — even on a potato 🥔
- 📦 **Tiny**: Uses a single JSON file as the model (kilobytes only!)
- 🧠 **Lightweight**: Minimal RAM usage — runs smoothly on *anything*, even low-spec devices
- 🪄 **Dynamic**: Smart placeholder functions like `{{name}}`, `{{timeOfDay}}`, and `{{randomEmoji}}`
- 🧰 **Offline-first**: 100% client-side. No APIs. No Internet. Works everywhere.

## 💬 Models

- Download models from the releases page to test Semi Intelligence!
- The `R` in the models stands for `Responses`, which means how many topics it can respond to!
- The more responses the smarter the SI model is.
> ### Jacob - 6R
> Jacob is your go-to SI model if you just want super-light, personalised responses, with snappy greetings, quick jokes and friendly farewells.

> ### Alex - 44R
> Alex is best for rich, context-aware conversations that adapt to your name, time and mood—delivering personalised greetings, fun facts, jokes and helpful insights across topics!

> ### Norman - 98R
> Norman is best for smart, topic-spanning chats that personalise by name and time, thoughtful insights and responses across **many** subjects.

If you’re after casual chat, I recommend Alex for its friendly tone, varied replies and intelligent insights.

## ⚠️ Important Warning

**Semi Intelligence is JUST that — semi-intelligent!**  
It’s super fast and lightweight, but it will often get stuff wrong or misunderstand you.  
Use it for fun, learning, and simple chats — but don’t expect a perfect AI genius yet! 🤖💥
